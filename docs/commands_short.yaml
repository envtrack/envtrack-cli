            Generate the autocompletion script for the bash shell.

            This script depends on the 'bash-completion' package.
            If it is not installed already, you can install it via your OS's package manager.

            To load completions in your current shell session:

            	source <(envtrack completion bash)

            To load completions for every new session, execute once:

            #### Linux:

            	envtrack completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/envtrack

            #### macOS:

            	envtrack completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/envtrack

            You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.
